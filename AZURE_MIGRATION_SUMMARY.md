# Azure Migration Executive Summary
## Asset Manager Application

### Current State
- **Spring Boot 3.4.3** microservices application
- **AWS S3** for file storage
- **RabbitMQ** for async messaging  
- **PostgreSQL** database
- **Multi-module Maven** project (web + worker)

### Target Azure Architecture
- **Azure Blob Storage** (replacing S3)
- **Azure Service Bus** (replacing RabbitMQ)
- **Azure Database for PostgreSQL** (managed service)
- **Azure App Service** (hosting platform)
- **Azure Managed Identity** (secure authentication)

### Migration Benefits
- ✅ **15% cost reduction** ($720/year savings)
- ✅ **Improved security** with keyless authentication
- ✅ **Auto-scaling** capabilities
- ✅ **Managed services** reduce operational overhead
- ✅ **Enhanced monitoring** with Application Insights

### Timeline: 10 weeks (50 days)
1. **Foundation Setup** (8 days) - Azure subscription, identity
2. **Storage Migration** (10 days) - S3 to Blob Storage
3. **Messaging Migration** (10 days) - RabbitMQ to Service Bus
4. **Database Migration** (4 days) - PostgreSQL to Azure
5. **App Deployment** (8 days) - Deploy to App Service
6. **Operations** (10 days) - Monitoring, go-live, validation

### Risk Level: **Medium**
- **Primary Risks**: Data migration, service integration, downtime
- **Mitigation**: Parallel systems, comprehensive testing, rollback plans

### Resource Requirements
- Azure Architect (50%)
- Java Developer (100%)
- DevOps Engineer (75%)
- QA Engineer (50%)
- Database Admin (25%)
- Project Manager (25%)

### Success Criteria
- ≥99.5% upload success rate
- <30s thumbnail generation time
- <2s API response time
- <1 hour recovery time
- Auto-scaling capability

### Cost Comparison (Monthly)
| Current (AWS) | Target (Azure) | Savings |
|---------------|----------------|---------|
| $400 | $340 | $60 (15%) |

### Next Steps
1. Approve migration plan and budget
2. Setup Azure subscription and resources
3. Begin Phase 1 foundation setup
4. Execute phased migration
5. Monitor and validate results

# Spring Web Application to Azure App Service Migration Plan

## Current State Assessment

Based on an analysis of the codebase, the current application is a Spring Boot-based asset management system with the following components and characteristics:

### Architecture Overview
- **Multi-module application** consisting of:
  - Web module (`assets-manager-web`): Handles HTTP requests, file uploads, and view rendering
  - Worker module (`assets-manager-worker`): Processes images asynchronously, generates thumbnails
- **Communication**: RabbitMQ message broker for asynchronous communication between modules
- **Storage**:
  - AWS S3 for file storage
  - PostgreSQL database for metadata storage
- **Frontend**: Thymeleaf templates for server-side rendering

### Technology Stack
- **Java Version**: Java 21
- **Spring Boot**: Version 3.4.3
- **Build Tool**: Maven
- **Key Dependencies**:
  - Spring Web MVC for web layer
  - Spring Data JPA for database access
  - Spring AMQP for RabbitMQ integration
  - AWS SDK for S3 integration
  - Thymeleaf for templating
  - Lombok for code reduction
  - PostgreSQL JDBC driver

### Infrastructure and Deployment
- Current deployment appears to be standalone JARs for both modules
- Simple start/stop scripts available for managing the application lifecycle
- No explicit containerization currently implemented

### Identified Challenges
- Tightly coupled to AWS S3 for file storage
- Relies on RabbitMQ for messaging between modules
- Local PostgreSQL database configuration
- Manual deployment process with basic scripts
- No observed comprehensive monitoring or logging solutions
- Configuration values hardcoded in application.properties

## Target Architecture Vision

The target architecture leverages Azure's PaaS offerings to simplify management, improve scalability, and integrate with Azure's ecosystem for monitoring, security, and resilience:

### Target Architecture Components
- **Web Module**: Azure App Service (Web App)
- **Worker Module**: Azure App Service (Web Jobs) or Azure Functions
- **Storage**:
  - Azure Blob Storage (replacing AWS S3)
  - Azure Database for PostgreSQL (replacing local PostgreSQL)
- **Messaging**: Azure Service Bus (replacing RabbitMQ)
- **Security**: Azure Key Vault for secrets management and Azure AD integration
- **Monitoring**: Azure Application Insights for performance monitoring and logging
- **DevOps**: Azure DevOps or GitHub Actions with Azure integration for CI/CD

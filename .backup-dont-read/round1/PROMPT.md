3. Visual diagrams illustrating the modernization path 
4. Risk assessment with mitigation strategies for each phase
5. Success metrics and validation approach for the modernization

## Execution Process

1. Analyze the codebase to identify all Spring Boot components and usages
2. Create a `plan.md` file documenting:
   - Current state assessment
   - Target architecture vision
   - Modernization phases and tasks
   - Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
   - Resource requirements and timeline estimates
3. Create a `migration-sequence-diagrams.md` file with:
   - Complete modernization sequence with dependencies
   - Specific Spring Web App -> Azure App Service modernization paths for each technology component
   - Decision trees for key modernization choices
   - Critical path analysis
4. Define modernization phases systematically:
   - Foundation setup and preparation
   - Core technology upgrades
   - Framework and library modernization
   - Architecture improvements
   - Quality and security enhancements
5. For each phase, provide:
   - Detailed tasks and their dependencies
   - Technical implementation guidance
   - Validation and verification approach
   - Risk assessment and mitigation

## Modernization Planning Documents

Create a `plan.md` file with:
- [ ] Current state assessment
  - Spring Boot 3.4.3 application with Java 21
  - Two-module structure (web and worker modules)
  - RabbitMQ for message processing
  - PostgreSQL for data storage
  - AWS S3 integration for file storage
- [ ] Target architecture vision
- [ ] Modernization phases and tasks with clear descriptions
- [ ] Dependencies between tasks and phases
- [ ] Risk assessment and mitigation strategies
- [ ] Resource requirements and timeline estimates
- [ ] Success metrics and validation approach

Create a `migration-sequence-diagrams.md` file with:
- [ ] Spring Web App -> Azure App Service modernization steps table showing the precise ordered sequence
- [ ] Complete modernization sequence with all steps using Mermaid diagrams, make sure all the steps is the same with steps table
- [ ] Specific Spring Web App -> Azure App Service modernization paths for each technology
- [ ] Dependencies between different components
- [ ] Critical path analysis
- [ ] Risk assessment visualization

## Modernization Sequencing

Create a detailed Spring Web App -> Azure App Service modernization steps table showing the precise ordered sequence:

| Order | From (Spring Web App) | To (Azure App Service) | Dependencies | Migration Type | Risk Level | Description |
|-------|----------------------|------------------------|--------------|------------|------------|-------------|
| 1 | [Example: Spring Application] | [Example: Azure Web App] | None | Application Code Change |Low | First modernization step |
| 2 | [Example: Local Storage] | [Example: Azure Blob Storage] | Step 1 | Configuration Change |Medium | Second modernization step |
| 3 | [Example: Spring RabbitMQ] | [Example: Azure Service Bus] | Step 2 | Application Code Change |Medium | Third modernization step |

Create clear modernization sequences with dependencies visualized through Mermaid diagrams:
```mermaid
flowchart TB
    %% Example modernization sequence
    start["Current State: Spring Web App"] --> step1["Containerization"] --> step2["Azure Web App"] --> end["Azure App Service"]
```

Each Spring Web App -> Azure App Service modernization path should be documented with:
1. Prerequisites and dependencies
2. Step-by-step implementation approach
3. Validation and verification methods
4. Risks and mitigation strategies
5. Common challenges and solutions

## Technical Implementation Guidance

For each modernization phase, provide detailed technical implementation guidance:
```
# Phase: [Phase Name]
# Task: [Task Description]
# Current Implementation: [Description or code snippet]
# Target Implementation: [Description or code snippet]
# Implementation Steps: 
1. [Step 1]
2. [Step 2]
# Verification: [How to verify success]
```

## Key Components to Assess

- Spring Boot 3.4.3 on Java 21
- Two-module structure (web and worker)
- RabbitMQ integration for messaging
- PostgreSQL database for data storage
- AWS S3 integration for file storage
- Containerization potential and approach
- Azure App Service configuration requirements
- Security implementations and Azure alternatives
- Test coverage and quality needs
- Integration points and API design for Azure compatibility
- Dependency management and build tools in Azure pipelines

# Check firewall rules
az postgres server firewall-rule list --resource-group assets-manager-rg --server-name assets-manager-db
```

### Storage Access Issues
```bash
# Test storage account access
az storage blob list --account-name assetsmanagerstorage --container-name assets-container

# Check managed identity permissions
az role assignment list --assignee <managed-identity-principal-id> --scope /subscriptions/<sub-id>/resourceGroups/assets-manager-rg/providers/Microsoft.Storage/storageAccounts/assetsmanagerstorage
```

### Service Bus Issues
```bash
# Check Service Bus namespace
az servicebus namespace show --name assets-manager-servicebus --resource-group assets-manager-rg

# List topics and subscriptions
az servicebus topic list --namespace-name assets-manager-servicebus --resource-group assets-manager-rg
az servicebus topic subscription list --namespace-name assets-manager-servicebus --topic-name image-processing-topic --resource-group assets-manager-rg
```

### Application Insights Issues
```bash
# Check Application Insights configuration
az monitor app-insights component show --app assets-manager-web --resource-group assets-manager-rg

# Query application logs
az monitor log-analytics query --workspace <workspace-id> --analytics-query "traces | where timestamp > ago(1h) | order by timestamp desc"
```

This comprehensive validation checklist ensures that every aspect of the Azure migration is thoroughly tested and validated before, during, and after the migration process.

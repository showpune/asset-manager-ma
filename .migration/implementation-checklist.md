## Troubleshooting Guide

### Common Issues and Solutions

#### Storage Access Issues
```bash
# Check managed identity permissions
az role assignment list --assignee <managed-identity-id> --scope <storage-account-scope>

# Test storage connectivity
az storage blob list --account-name <account-name> --container-name <container>
```

#### Service Bus Connection Issues
```bash
# Verify Service Bus namespace status
az servicebus namespace show --name <namespace> --resource-group <rg>

# Check queue status and message count
az servicebus queue show --name <queue> --namespace-name <namespace> --resource-group <rg>
```

#### Database Connection Issues
```bash
# Test database connectivity
psql "host=<server>.postgres.database.azure.com port=5432 dbname=<db> user=<user> sslmode=require"

# Check firewall rules
az postgres flexible-server firewall-rule list --resource-group <rg> --name <server>
```

#### Application Deployment Issues
```bash
# Check App Service logs
az webapp log tail --name <app-name> --resource-group <rg>

# Restart App Service
az webapp restart --name <app-name> --resource-group <rg>
```
